                    <h2>Welcome to the the webpage where you can see the people responsible for this assignment: Algorithm Design Group 2!</h2><br/>
<p>&#11088;Camille Nampetch</p>
<p>&#x2B50;Sandra Vestergård</p>
<p>&#x2B50;Magdalena Pavlova</p> 
<h3>In our algorithm design project, we have defined a role and a responsibility for each of the group members to ensure smooth and efficient progress.<br>
    Camille is primarily responsible for the creation of the algorithm and its optimization, Sandra is focused on maintaining and managing our GitHub repository,
    and Magdalena is dedicated to the creation of the project's website. <br>
    The collective decision to divide our labor in that way was driven by our recognition of our unique strengths but also our shared Library and Information Science background. We believed that by focusing on tasks aligned with our individual skills and experiences, but which are also challenging and new to us, we could push ourselves to do even better and achieve more as a team. This division made us work smoothly and effectively, making the most of our combined knowledge for the success of our project. <br>
    It is also important to note, that while each of us has our distinct roles, our contributions are interconnected, and we actively support and complement each other in our respective areas of expertise.</h3>
