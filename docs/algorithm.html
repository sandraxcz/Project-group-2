                <p> <h3>Our algorithm is a Book recommendation algorithm, and it is written in pseudocode and Python. We decided to submit both versions, since we felt that this is a opportunity to receive feedback on our progress. We have a dataset containing book headings, their author, and their genre. We chose the sequences WRITE and READ, since they look simpler to understand and are also human readable. Concerning the structure, we have defined a number for each genre, ranging from 1 to 11, using the IF ELSE condition, since we thought that it is the most appropriate for this type of list. Since the user has the option to select more than one recommendation, a loop had to be created as well. For this, we used WHILE instead of the for I structure, since it is easier to understand at this stage. <br>
                    It is also important to note that the idea for the conceptualization of the algorithm was inspired by our sharing similar background in Library and Information Science.
